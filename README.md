# Alzheimer-Diagnosis-Using-Brain-Signal-Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting Alzheimer's disease using EEG data. The project uses advanced signal processing techniques and multiple machine learning classifiers to accurately distinguish between healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease based on their brain wave patterns.
